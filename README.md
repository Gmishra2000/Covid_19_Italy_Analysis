# Covid_19_Italy_Analysis
This is a short analysis on a dataset from italy provinces covid cases. I have used here seaborn library scatter plot to find out relationship between number of total cases and other parameter on italy covid 19 dataset. I have found that there is linear relationship between the number of cases and recovery rate of patients.
As the curve reached out the peak and got falttened through the relationship between the no of cases and person hospitalized, cases has started to get decreased. Dataset is available on kaggle.
